# Astro Plasmas - Lecture 1

Probably will go onto paper for this course.

Each lecture will have notes put onto the VLE prior to the lecture taking place

Do try and read before them.

Have a look at gaussian units c.g.s.

Temperature will be in eV again.

An energy density is a pressure J/m<sup>3</sup> = Pa

High > 1Mbar = 10<sup>11</sup>Pa = 10<sup>11</sup>J/m<sup>3</sup>

Supernova cause cosmic radiation.

MOst astro plasmas are collisionless.
