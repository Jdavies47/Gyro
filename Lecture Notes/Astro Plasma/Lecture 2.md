# Astro Plasmas - lecture 2

APP - astrophysical plasmas, a quasi-neutral body of matter:
&lambda;<sub>D</sub>, N<sub>D</sub>, &omega;<sub>pe</sub>, &omega;<sub>pi</sub>, &Omega;, r<sub>L</sub>

Density, particle density, pressure->temperature, magnetic field, fluid flow.

Collisions in a plasma

Collision frequency: vc~nv&pi;b<sup>2</sup>
but collisions are dominated by weak collisions within the debye length. These are small angle deflections. Generally we define a collision as having occurred when the deflection angle is greater than 90 degrees. Typically this requires 3 or more deflections.

 The coulomb log ln(&Lambda;) = ln(b<sub>max</sub>/b<sub>min</sub>)~ln(&lambda;<sub>D</sub>/r<sub>c</sub>) = 10-20.

 in a PPQ:
ln(&Lambda;) = 6.6 - 1/2 ln(n/10<sup>20</sup>)+3/2ln(Te(eV))

Electron m.f.p. &lambda;<sub>e</sub> = v<sub>e</sub>&tau;<sub>ei</sub> (between electrons and ions)

PPQ->compare with typical parameters of various astronomical systems

-> Then we compare to the lab

-> can we do something similar??? CAN WE??????????? I need to know!!!!!

Boyd+sanderson - Chapter 1

### Hydrodynamics (or MHD)

When does this model apply?
- need characteristic scale, L,sub>H</sub>, and it depends on the system and the question asked. But we know that &lambda;<sub>e</sub> << l(not a one, the letter l) << L<sub>H</sub>
  - l is the 'fluidisation scale' over which hydro properties are defined.
    - E.g pressure, density, flow, Etc
  - How ever &lambda;<sub>i</sub>(SN1006)>L<sub>H</sub>!!!
- Collisionless Plasmas:
  - Coulomb collsions are rare yet particle scattering are mediated by charged particle wave interactions. (Magnetic waves in astro-plasmas) These waves can be electrostatic or magnetostatic. An imcoming particle stimulates a plasma wave (magentosonic, Alfenic) on a B-field line. The particle self-scatters from the wave if:
    - The gyro-frequency or Larmour radius and the wave frequency are resonant.
  - A number of scatterings are required to drive an "effective" collision. FLuid behaviour emerges on scales of many effective collisions.
  - Here we require the larmour radius to be alot smaller the l which is much smaller than L<sub>H</sub>.
  - A plasma consists of a distribution of particles which drive a "zoo" waves in a system.
  - This drives turbulance of B and also in flows (u) - in a non linear complex way.
