### Basic Laser

LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)

Stimulated Emission: an excited quantum state decays as a result of interaction with an incoming photon and produces a photon of identical in frequency, phase, polarisation and wave vector.

Light Amplification: Stimulated Emission needs to dominate over competing photon absorption process.

### The Laser Idea

THinknig about a laser medium, some radiation comes into a thin bit of laser medium, and passing through and coming out with an increased Flux (F) of F+dF.

Stimulated emission is proportional to the flux F and upper state population denisty N<sub>2</sub>.

Absorption proportional to the Flux F and lower state population denisty N<sub>1</sub>.

dF = (&sigma;<sub>21</sub>FN<sub>2</sub>-&sigma;<sub>12</sub>FN<sub>1</sub>)

With the two sigmas related to each other via degeneracies of the lower and upper states (g).

Gain coefficient &alpha;.

F<sub>out</sub> = F<sub>0</sub> exp[&alpha;L]

THe value of &alpha; determines the rate of absorption/emission.

ROund Trip: Photon traverses along the cavity to mirror, reflects to other mirror and finishes where it started (travelling in same direction).

Laser Threshold: Stimulated emission gain => mirror losses

When they are equal the round trip amp = 1

Threshold gain coefficient: Rexp[2&alpha;<sub>th</sub>L] = 1

&alpha;<sub>th</sub> = -ln(R)/2L

### Pumping and population inversion

Looking at the gain coefficient, we need it to be greater than zero. This is why we need population inversion, we need more atoms in the excited state then the relaxed state.

In thermal equib, the required population is not reached, as it follows the boltzmann distribution.

Finding a system of atoms where we get the population inversion is the difficult part.

Looking at a energy level diagram we need to "pump" electrons up to the excited state. Using a external light source. THe pump photons are absorbed by state N<sub>1</sub> exciting electrons to N<sub>2</sub>.

THIS DOES NOT WORK DUE TO STIMULATED EMISSION.

We commonly assume the degeneracies are equal, or just a factor so ignore them from the equations.

To get around this we consider more energy level systems, and excited electrons to higher levels. The electrions then drop too the lower levels, producing fast decays and laser decays.

What does fast decay mean? THe time is takes to decay compared to the stimulated emission of the ground state and the top excited level.

Quantum efficiency: rtion of energy laser photon and pump photon.
