# Lasers - lecture 5

This is a big derivation Lecture

We start with Maxwell laws

Looking at propagation of EM waves.
  - Start with Maxwells equations:
    - Amperes law - Curl of H
    - Faradays Law - Curl of E

P is the polarisation term, kai is the complex susceptibility and &epsilon;<sub>r</sub>.

n is the refractive index.

c is the speed of light and it has an equation in the notes.

We are going to assume that:
- meu r is equal to 1
- j = 0
- insulating material (vacuum, air, laser crystal)
- Charge Density rho average over a large volume compared to size of atoms is zero. => del dot E is zero.

Amperes law is equation 1, faradays is equation 2.

If we take the curl of equation 2 then subsitute equation one into equation two via the curl of H.

Curl Curl of E is equal to a vector identity.

This produces the wave equation.

Look for a trial solution, hopefully the guess (in x,y,z) is in the notes

Omega is the angular frequency of the light which is related to the wave number k.

Phi has only spacial dependence, no time.

substitute into the wave equation.

We need: Another equation in the notes, which separates out the the derivative in the z direction.


This produces a eqaution similar to the wave dependence but with no time dependence.

If K is a large number then we can ignore the second derivative.

This produces the paraxial wave equation.

We now want to find solutions to this equation, that are cylindrically symmetrical. This way we can represent the beam with a radius rather than a x-y system.

q(z) has to be of the form z+iz(0)

Look at z=0: => q(z)=iz(0)
