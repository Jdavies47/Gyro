The equations with amplitude, longitudinal phase, radial phase and temporal phase.

w is related to the width of the beam (the radius in this case).

Now looking at a lens of diameter D, and focal length f.

2w<sub>0</sub> is the diameter in focus.

with &theta;/2 = tan<sup>-1</sup>(D/2f), but due to small angles we can approx to D/2f

Therefore with beam waist is 2w<sub>0</sub> = 4&lambda;<sub>0</sub>f/&pi;nD

f/d is the f number

n is the refractive index.

immersion lithography

Z<sub>0</sub> is the rayliegh length.

z<sub>0</sub> is the measure of the distance beyond which ray tracing becomes valid.

Now looking at the radial phase term

Equiphase surfaces are spherical with curvature R(z).

The minimum radius of curvature; i.e. the most curved is found by dR(z)/dz=0

1-(z<sub>0</sub>/z)=0

Gauss0Hermite Polynomials are designated by 2 numbers. The solution to the wave equation are designate by the same numbers used as a subscript to letters TEM (Transverse Elctrmagnetic)

e.g. TEM<sub>00</sub>, TEM <sub>12</sub>

These re cylindrically symmetric

E = E<sub>mp</sub>H<sub>m</sub>(X)H<sub>p</sub>(Y) x .......
