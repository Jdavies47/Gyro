### Chemical Binding and Non-bonded Interactions

##### Nucleic Acids

- DNA is a nucleic acid
- Long chained molecules that wrap up into complex shapes.
- DNA forms into a very regular helix structure
- Transfer RNA is much bigger, but has smaller sub-structures throughout the molecules
- Bonds can be made out in the shape of the molecule.
- What are the forces involved that create these shapes

##### Proteins

- Long chain of single molecules that create complex shapes.
  - helix's
  - chains
- Where does the structure come from?

##### Atomic Orbitals

- This is not in the recommended readding, but there is notes on the VLE. (course content/subfolders)

### Chemical Bonding

##### The Covalent Bonding

1. Chemical bond that involves "sharing" electrons.
1. Atoms attain a closed outer shell of electrons.
1. They are very strong bonds (>>k<sub>b</sub>T)
1. They are short range bonds (<5&#x212B;)
1. Two types of bonds
 - &sigma; bonds
 - &pi; bonds
1. They require overlap of atomic orbitals
1. Atomic states from the solution from the SchrÃ¶dinger equations (Wavefunctions) are these orbital shapes.

**Hydrogen** - Ground state 1s<sup>1</sup>
  - Overlap s orbitals -> &sigma; bond.
  - This is known as a molecular orbital
  - The wavefunction for the two electrons after a bond represents a cloud between the two nuclei.
  - The s shell it self is a atomic orbital.
  - The bond &sigma; is cylindrically symmetric.

**Carbon** - (This is of greater interest in biology) ground state:1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sub>x</sub><sup>1</sup>2p<sub>y</sub><sup>1</sup>
  - Bonding:  
    - 1s<sup>2</sup> play no role (too deep)
    - 4e<sup>-</sup> available for bonding?
    - **OR** 2e<sup>-</sup> with 2s electrons not parcipitating?
    - **OR** 2s<sup>1</sup>2p<sub>x</sub><sup>1</sup>2p<sub>y</sub><sup>1</sup>2p<sub>z</sub><sup>1</sup>

##### sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid atomic orbitals in carbon

This chemical shows that carbon can make 4 bonds.

But we have methane: CH<sub>4</sub>
- All the bonds are identical (from observation).
- Carbon can form atomic hybrid orbitals

##### sp<sup>3</sup> hybrids
&Psi;<sub> sp<sup>3</sup></sub> = K(&psi;<sub>2s</sub> + &psi;<sub>2p<sub>x</sub></sub> + &psi;<sub>2p<sub>y</sub></sub> + &psi;<sub>2p<sub>z</sub></sub>)

- Linear combination of 2s and 2p orbitals
- The small lobe an small lobe are all one structure. (Wavefunction probability shape)
- Tetrahedron shape (109.5&deg; between bonds)

molecular C-H bond is now formed from overlap of the orbitals:
- 1C sp<sup>3</sup> state + 1H 1s state -> C-H called &sigma;
- Each sigma bond contains 2 electrons.
- &#8756; all bonding electrons are accounted for.
- cylindrical symmetry -> rotation is possible
- Energy of (C-H)<sub>&sigma;</sub> bond ~ 99kcal/mole (>>k<sub>b</sub>T)
- Thermal energy will not break this bond.

Key characteristic of single bonds, is that you can rotate around them without effecting the energy.

### CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (ethane)
