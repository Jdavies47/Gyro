### Entropy, Boltzmann and Gibbs

*Thermal effects are very significant in biological systems.*

At room temperature k<sub>b</sub>T = 2.5kJ/mol [4.2J = 1cal]

This is also equal to :
  - 25meV/mol
  - 0.6kcal/mol
  - 4.1pNnm

#### Free Energy

Helmholtz free energy: For a process that takes place at constant T.

`F = U-TS`

Gibbs free energy: For a process that takes place at constant T and P.

`G = U-TS+PV`

During a process, the changes are:

&Delta;F = &Delta;U-T&Delta;S; &Delta;G= &Delta;U-T&Delta;S+P&Delta;V

but &Delta;V ~ 0, so &Delta;F~&Delta;G and therefore it doesnt matter whether we use for F or G.

### The natural direction of processes

As a system approaches equilibrium:

&Delta;G &lt; or equal to 0

***So G ~ U - TS is minimised at equilibrium.*** - this is key

This implies decreasing I or increasing S or both.

Processes are driven by the internal energy and S.

**N.B** Entropic term becomes more significant at high temperature.

Maximising S involves finding the macro state with the largest number of corresponding microstates.

### Possible models of macromolecules (1) DNA

- Sequence: This is the kind of level of detail that provides nothing about the structure, but other properties can be found in this
- Binding State: Looks at a long thin thing which a molecule can bind onto, so DNA can be seen as binding sites.
- Charged rod: Can be seen a tube of negative charges on a bendy rod. Can be used to look at the surroundings, producing electro-neutrality.
- Elastic rod: Can look at its physics properties, stretchy and  bendy. Proteins can bend a twist DNA.
- Random walk: Can be seen as a chain of connected cylinders, how does it fold about and shape itself. (Stat mech) (comes back to this is in a later lectures.)

### Possible models of macromolecules (1)

- Amino acid Sequence
- HP models (hydrophillic and phobic molecules)
- Ribbon diagrams (Shows internal structure, locally)
- Compact random walk (When looking at protein folding)
- Receptor (Looking at molecules that bind to proteins)
- Two state system (Proteins can take two states)

### Possible contributions to U in biological systems

Consider a polymer:

1. as a uniform rod
  - U depends on the degree of stretching and bonding
1. as a collection of atoms
  - U depends on:
    - covalent binds - e.g. stretching
    - electrostatic Interactions
    - van der Waals interactions
    - Hydrogen bonds
1. binding to another molecule (ligand)
  - U depends on the same as above plus the energy of interaction.

### Energy as a function of length scale

Look at the graph.

### Schematic Representation of an isolated system with sub-compartments separated by a barrier

Looking at three systems, iwth different barriers

1. First one the barrier is rigid and only energy can pass through.
1. Second one is a moveable barrier which the net force from the particles can move it.
1. The last one has holes in it allowing some particles to pass through.

### Attaining equilibrium by maximising S

Second law of thermodynamics: an isolated system attains thermodynamic equilibrium when its **entropy is maximised**

Box 1: Flow of energy is allowed

- Consider S = S<sub>1</sub>(E<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>N<sub>1</sub>) + S<sub>2</sub>(E<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>)
- Where E = E<sub>1</sub> + E<sub>2</sub>; V = V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub>; N = N<sub>1</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>

note: this is true as the system is isolated

So dS = (d<sub>1</sub>/dE<sub>1</sub>)dE<sub>1</sub> + (dS<sub>2</sub>/dE<sub>2</sub>)dE<sub>2</sub>

but dE<sub>1</sub> = -dE<sub>2</sub>

so d<sub>1</sub>/dE<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>2</sub>/dE<sub>2</sub> = 0 at equilibrium

Therefore they are equal but opposite in sign.

but by definition dS/dE = 1/T => 1/t1 = 1/t2


### Possible arrangements of proteins on a DNA molecule
