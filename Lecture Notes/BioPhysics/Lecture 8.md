***Freely Jointed chain model of DNA***

## Possible models of macromolecules (1) DNA

Phenomenological parameters
  - To design a bridge you dont need to know atomic structure of the materials.#
  - You need to know bulk properties
  - e.g. bulk modulus, sheer modulus, etc.
  - These useful parameters are known as Phenomenological parameters.
  - We can do this kind of thing for DNA.
  - Behaviours of DNA on long length scales does not depend on atomic structure.
    - There is a Phenomenological parameter for DNA known as persistence length.

#### Random Walk

The rod length shown in the pictures are known as the persistence length. This can be variable depending on the DNA. The persistence length lets you know the flexibility of the DNA.

Bending of a rod in a heat bath.

E = (&pi;A/4R)k<sub>B</sub>T

The length A is the persistence length.

- For R >> A, E << k<sub>B</sub>T (Its quite easy)
- Elastic rod in solution will be randomly bent if the contour length (the end to end length including the curves it takes) L<sub>T</sub> > A.

#### Why is a polymer coiled in solution

G = U - TS (+PV)

The internal energy doesnt really change when bending the rod (DNA). &Delta;U ~ 0

Whilst &Delta;S (more end to end distance fit in the same distance, so more likely to see bent up polymers.) In creasing S reduces the Gibbs free energy, which is what is required for equilibrium.

#### Single Molecule Force spectroscopy I

(This comes up in the second half this course.)

XRD was the old way of looking at these molecules.
