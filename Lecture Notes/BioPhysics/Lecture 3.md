### sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid atomic orbitals and &pi; bonds

It can also be seen that there are molecules have seem to be observed having a "double bond" between the carbons.

**Ethylene** H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sb>

- sp<sup>2</sup> hybrids
  - &Psi; = K(&psi;<sub>2s</sub> + &psi;<sub>2p<sub>x</sub></sub> + &psi;<sub>2p<sub>y</sub></sub>)
  - We see that the orbitals essentially lie in a plane. (flat on the paper)
  - All the bonds to the hydrogens are sigma bonds. (120&deg; apart)
  - The centre bond is also a sigma bond, but there is also another bond which is created from the fusing of the "leftover" electrons. This is known as a pi bond.

The rotation about a pi bond is "impossible".
 - The energy involved in a double bond is approx. 147kcal/J
 - Whilst a single bind is about 83kcal/J
 - Energy required to rotate around a double bond (break to a single then rotate) is ~64kcal/J >> k<sub>b</sub>T

#### sp hybrid atomic orbitals

- triple bond
- 180&deg; apart
- H-C<triple line>C-H

### Quantum Mechanical Resonance

Two states with the same energy, but with differences. Look at nitrogen molecule in leaflet. They are both low energy state, the system will flick back and forth between the two states. This frequency of flicking is known as Quantum Mechanical Resonance.

##### The peptide bonds

1. The chemical on (2) (the chemical repeat unit of a protein molecule). This puts a constraint on the types or proteins that can be made.
  - This is the basis of an amino acids
  - protein is a chain of amino acids
  - The structure of this molecule can be changed, where the double bond is.
  - This change of the double bond from the oxygen to the nitrogen from the carbon, it goes from a neutral molecule to a negative charge on the oxygen and a positive charge on the nitrogen.
  - The molecule resonates between these two states
  - The consequence of this the "bonding" electron is half the time between the oxygen and the nitrogen, making the bond order 1.5 rather than 2.
  - They still behave like a double bond and it prevents rotation about these 1.5 bonds.
  - It is a planar unit (peptide).

##### Aromatic Ring (They actually smell nice)

- 6 carbons in a ring, with a hydrogen associated with each carbon.
- It has 3 double bonds, but they can resonant between which atoms the double bonds are.
- So each "double bond" is actually 1.5
- This produces a ring current, which can be measured by the magnetic dipole produced from the electrons moving.
- All of the carbon atoms are in a plane and are rigid. They are also about 3-4&#8491; thick.

Examples of these rings:
- A,T,C,G - which are the basis in DNA molecules.

### Non-bonded Interactions

1. Electrostatic Interactions
  - Coulomb interaction between two opposite charges
  - N-A-A-N is a symmetrical distribution of charge
  - N-A-B-N is not, more electrons gather in the area of one of the atoms, producing a &delta;+ and a &delta;- known as partial charges on the molecule.
1. van der Waals Interactions
1. Hydrogen bonds
