##### Background Information

Biology is as diverse as physics, but without the fundamental aspect to work from basics.

Robert Hook, was looking at slices of animals and organisms, but when he looked at one specimen, he noticed lots of small structures inside the sample. What he had found was the idea of the biological cell. The organism takes lots of these cells in a regular layout to make more complex organisms. (The atom of the biology world).

There are many types of cells, and using different types of cells, different organisms can be made.

When we start looking inside the cell, they too like atoms, are made up of other parts, like proteins and acids, etc. All the huge diversity of organisms boil down to being made from different types of cells.

##### Looking inside the Cells

E.coli is a typical unicellular organism.

It is a very simple rectangular cell. We can view it in different forms, AFM produces a physical image of the cell, noticing things like flagella and pili. Electron microscopes show inside the cell showing DNA inside, but the image shows structure and not just a "blob" of material. These cells are in the scale 2x1 micrometres.

These cells can almost be used as a small ruler to measure other cells.

##### Schematic Structure and contents of E.coli

Can be broken down into a number of molecules:

- Water ~ 2x10<sup>10</sup>
- Membrane proteins ~ 10<sup>6</sup>
- inorganic ion (sodium, potassium, magnesium) ~ 6x10<sup>7</sup>
- lipid ~ 5x10<sup>7</sup>
- protein ~ 2x10<sup>6</sup>
- DNA ~ 5x10<sup>6</sup> bp
- Ribosome ~ 2x10<sup>4</sup> (huge molecular machine)
- mRNA ~ 2x10<sup>3</sup>

mRNA contains a message, which is read by the ribosome to produce DNA.

Membrane Proteins apply work to get material out of the cell, and transport material back into the cell. (Electrical Gradients).

### Two Major types of cells

##### Eukaryote Cells

- Contains a nucleus
- Most animals and plants

##### Prokaryote

- No cell nucleus (E.coli)
- Simpler cells

Another typical distinction between cells are Animals and plant cells

Animal cells have a cell membrane which is malleable.

Plant cells do not have a membrane, but a rigid cell wall.

There is a huge number of cells, of massively different size and functions. On the handout there is pictures to scale of a few examples.

Going smaller than E.coli, by factor 10 we can see a bacteriophage which is a virus (0.1 micrometres). These are complex bacterium that can recognise the type of cell it wants to invade. It lands on the cell and can puncture the cell membrane and pump its own DNA into the cell it is attacking to control it. Looking smaller gain we can see viral capsid's (10nm), this is the head of the virus. In this head it contains DNA (1nm). These are made up of bases (0.1nm) which are formed from pairs that stick together. This is the size scale that this course will be operating in.
