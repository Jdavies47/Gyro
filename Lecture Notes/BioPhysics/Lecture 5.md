### Proteins

Proteins have a wide range of functions

- Enzymes: DNA polymerase
  - it takes nucleotides and sticks them together to form a polymer
  - Biological catalyst
- Muscle: myosin
  - this is used for movement.
- Storage: ferritin
  - Spherical with a hole in the middle.
  - Stored iron moleculea
- Mouse cholera antibody
  - Response to invasions, bacteria and virus.
- Structure: Collagen
  - Long chain molecule
  - The most prevalent protein in mammals
  - molecule of which skin and bone are made.

The shape of proteins is very important, how a protein functions rely on it.

Proteins are linear polymers built from amino acids

Amino acids are very simple, made up a central carbon, (alpha carbon) attached to ammine group and a carboxyl group. There is also a R group, there is about 20 different groups.

Amino acids can be linked together via  a peptide bond. snips off the OH group and the H from the nitrogen and it creates a bond between the two aminoacids, C-N. (covalent bond). Two together are called dipeptide. The number of peptide bond chains is not limited.

Dihedral angle is the angle between two planes.

Quantum mechanical resonance: the peptide bond is a partial double-bond so &Omega; is fixed.

Ramachandran plot: &Psi; and &Phi; can vary but in most proteins they are not uniformly distributed.

The &alpha;-helix is formed when the NH on aa<sub>i</sub> makes a hydrogen bond with the CO on aa<sub>i+4</sub>

aa = amino acid.

&beta; sheets are also stabilised by hydrogen bonds between the NH and OH. Depending on the orientation of the proteins, you get a parallel or anti parallel confirmations.

What is R?

Amino acids are hydrophobic, polar or charged. (groups)

Protein chains fold so that the hydrophobic groups are mainly on the inside and the hydrophilic groups are mainly are on the outside.
