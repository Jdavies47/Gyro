### Nucleic Acids

There is more notes on the VLE.

Going to write the notes with slide titles

##### Slide 1

- We are looking at a virus with the DNA being blown out, intentionally.
- Its is one strand of DNA.
- They are huge, very heavy and are very thin

##### Slide 2
- DNA is simple, and only consists of 4 sub unit, that are covalently bonded to one another.
- It is one lone chain, with no breaks, made up of nucleotides
- Proteins are also long chains like DNA made up of amino acids (about 20 different natural types)

##### Slide 3
- Looking at a nucleotides
- Will never be asked to draw these.
- Comprised of three sub units
  - Sugar - pentose sugar
    - If there are two OH groups then it is a ribose
    - If one of them is H then it is a deoxyrobise (the D in DNA)
  - Phosphate group
    - Phosphor atoms, bonded to 4 oxygen's
    - Bonded at the 5' position
    - there is a negative charge on one of the oxygen's
    - makes DNA an acid
    - Only one phosphate group present in DNA.
  - base
    - Made up of aromatic rings 3-4 Amstrongs thick
    - Group called the pyrimidines
      - Cytosine - ring, similar to benzene, there is nitorgen
      - complicated groups attached to the ring
      - Thymine - same ring structure as Cytosine, but different groups attached.
      - These are two of the four nucleotides that make up DNA
      - Uracil - is a fifth rare nucleotide of DNA but it is found RNA. Thymine isnt found in RNA.
    - Purines
      - double rings with differing groups attached
    - The R is connected to the sugar at the BASE label. This is known as glyosidic bond

##### Slide 5

- Nucleotides link together via phosphodiester bond.
- The nucleotides are bonded together by a shared oxygen in a phosphate group (5' to 3')
- It doesnt matter what base is attached to the sugars.
- At the end of DNA strand, is called the 5' end.
- At the other end you have the 3' end.
- Not identical ends, there is a direction to the DNA

##### Slide 6

Density of DNA in solution => 2 Chains of nucleotides

Chargaff rules
1. [Pu]=[Py] (the concentration/mounts) (purines and pyrimidines)
1. [A]=[T]
1. [G]=[C]

Hydrogen Bonding in water and ice

Non uniformly distributed electrons in bonds, producing small positive and negative regions on certain atoms. These produce bond via a electrostatic/quantum mechanical interaction.

These are very small charges so the bond is very weak. Less than k<sub>b</sub>T

##### Slide 7

Watson-Crick base-pairs form via hydrogen bonds.

Hydrogen bonds between the bases A-T and G-C

##### Slide 8

one strand will have the 3' on the top and 5' on the bottom, an the opposite on the other strand.

5' to 3' generally.
