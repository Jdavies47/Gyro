### Simulating Intercalation

Intercalation is a rare event on the molecular dynamics time scale (~100ns);

  - diffusion of ligand
  - creation of a Intercalation site

So we need to induce then Intercalation into the site with targeted molecular dynamics.

We need to find a way of causing a molecule to intercalate with DNA.

### What is a targeted molecular dynamics?

Look on the lecture slides on the VLE to see the equations.
