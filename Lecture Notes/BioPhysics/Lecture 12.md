# Biophysics - lecture 12 07/11/2017

##### Finishing off from last lecture: (THAT I MISSED)

Looking at water:

- Hydrogen bonds in water, looking at a crude model there is 6 possible orientations of the water molecule.
- Any hydrophobic molecule would stop any hydrogen bonds, if we bring in one, we reduce the number of orientations to 3.

&Delta;G = &Delta;U + nk<sub>B</sub>Tln(2)

where n is the number of H<sub>2</sub>) molecules adjacent to the hydrophobic molecule.

&Delta;U is actually very close to zero, this is because of the hydrophobic molecule doesn't really effect things like covalent bonds, etc.

Therefore:

&Delta;G ~ nk<sub>B</sub>Tln2

SUppose the presence of a hydrophobic molecule incurs some free energy penalty per unit area, which is &gamma;. Then the "energy cost" to embed a molecule in water is:

&Delta;G = &gamma;A where A is the effective area of the interface between the molecules and water.

- Area covered by 10 water molecules ~ 1 nm<sup>2</sup>
- ln2 ~ 0.7

- Therefore to immerse a hydrophobic molecule in water:

&Delta;G ~ 7k<sub>B</sub>T/nm<sup>2</sup>

Examples:

***O<sub>2</sub>***  : Area ~ 0.1-0.2 nm<sup>2</sup>

Therefore &Delta;G ~ k<sub>B</sub>T

This means that some would dissolve in the water and some wouldn't as this is roughly the same energy of it being in the atmosphere.

***Oil+Water*** : &Delta;G ~ 15k<sub>B</sub>T to immerse a single octane molecule in water.

CH<sub>3</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - ...  - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>3</sub>

It doesnt really want to dissolve into water. So if poured into water they form small oil droplets (sphere) as only molecules that are touching the water, so the penalty energy is reduced.

After a long period of time the two liquids completely separate to reduce the energy cost, reducing the Gibbs energy. This is because the interface area is reduced in this form compared to the spheres.

### Membranes and the Piosson-Boltzman Equation

#### Molecular contents of the E.coli Bacterium

This slide has been shown to show the importance of membranes. Surrounding all the contents of the cells is the membranes. It has to keep the cell intact, but allowing transfers at the same time. It is often found that other things are embedded into the cell.

#### Key Molecules of the cell membranes

5 complicated molecules, but they are generally made of lipid molecules.

They contain chains of CH2, so they are very hydrophobic chains. There are components of the lipids though, like phosphate groups. These phosphate groups typically have a charge. This end of the molecule likes being in water (hydrophilic). This is common throughout the 5 types of lipids.

Cholesterol is a small part of most cell membranes.

So in general these lipids have a hydrophobic and hydrophilic end.

#### Structure and properties of biological membranes.

Amphilphilic molecule, a molecules that has both phobic and phillic components like lipids.

These Structures in water organise themselves together with the tails pointing inwards to each other and the phosphate groups towards the water.

Membrane referred to as bi-layer as you typically have two to perform this.

This "joined" molecules are actually quite flexible:
  - The lipids molecule can diffuse around the surface. "2D fluid model"
  - Things can easily be pushed through them.
  - They can change which layer it is in.
