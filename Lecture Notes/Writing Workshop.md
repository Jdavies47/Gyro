# Writing Workshop

Slides will be on the VLE.

### Structure your wtiting

Funnels:
1. These are a way of structuring your Writing.
1. A natural way to make your work interesting and relevant to her researchers/people/dog.
1. Tune the breadth of your writing to the reader and how far they have to read through your writing.
1. Ensures that the writing flows from something relevant to the minutiae of your project.

##### Introduction

- Motivation - Motivate your project with something that EVERYONE cares about. (Hook) How does the project relate worldwide context. (why is this important). (understandable to everyone)
- Focus - Gradually focus down your topic to your research area. How does your field of research relate to the big problem?
- Question - What specific research question (make it specific). It is the whole reason, it has to be valid and measurable. (Need a PhD to know what you are discussing)

##### Activity

Development of a dynamic PID relation values for gyroscopic stabilisation systems for motorbikes.

With some accidents on motorbikes due to loss of traction of wheels leading to fall of the motorbike, maintaining/changing the angle of motorbike during these incidents would allow greater control a better chance of recovery.

##### The Middle

The bulk of your report, understandable to yourself and someone with a PhD in Physics. This section is about scientific credibility. Why should someone believe your results.

- Theory, what is the physical basis for your project. Outline the physics principles that you will use in your project. What are the limits of the theory. Demonstrate that you understand the theory.
- Methods, Describe the experimental apparatus/ computational model. What are the limits of the methods. Show that you understand the methods. (STOP here for project review)
- Results, describe your results and their physical significance. Your results should form a narrative story. Describe what you did and what your results show.
- Discussion, how did your results contribute to answer the question of the research question. Interpret your resuts0 what physical insight do they provide. Do your results pose additional questions? Often sensible to combine the results and the discussion.

##### Figure Captions

- Figure captions should state what is plotted or shown.
- Describe what happens in the figure.
- Place what happens in the figure in context:
  1. Describe the physics behind what you observe.
  1. how does this contribute to the story?
- Long Captions

##### Then End

The conclusions collate your results in the context of your research question.

Did you answer your question?

How does that relate to question in your research area, field and the big problem you identified  at the beginning.

  - Conclusions
  - Further work

### Scientific Writing

##### Marking Criteria

- Outstanding presentation
- Fluent accurate writing style
- Excellent standard of scientific investigation
- Good figures and tables, well captions, all number and referred to in the text.
- Complete sentences.

##### Common problems

- Poor Structure
- Poor paragraph style
- Complex sentences
- Verbose Language

##### Perfect Paragraphs

A good well structured paragraph will:
- Present the Topic/point in the first line.
- Provide evidence to support the point and identify its significance.
- Should link well to the next paragraph.

##### Getting good at grammar

- Tense, keep consistence. Refer to your findings in past tense. For Statements of general validity use present tense.
- Avoid contractions, (don't -> do not)
- Brevity, condensing your writing makes it clearer. Consider what words are not needed to make your point. Omit overview words. Reduce the number of adjectives. Look out for clauses. Avoid intensifiers such as really, very, quite, they are not precise.
- Passible and active voices, can use both. Active voice is clearer to let the reader know what is happening.

### Take away messages

- Use Funnels
- Spell check your writing
- Make sure each paragraph has a point.
- Dont use contractions
- Use active voice when you want to be direct.
