### Common Semiconductors

Silicon is the most dominant semiconductor due to its prise. It is one of the cheapest semiconductors to mass produce. It is a diamond structure, two lattices, one [1/4,1/4,1/4].

Wurtzite Structure, is a hexagonal structure, but is very hard to add silicon too. It is very common though as GaN is this structure and this is used in common devices like LED's. Changing the elements used in this structure, we can change the colour of the LED's. AlN is used for water purification due to the wavelength produced.

Go over the Miller indices!!

#### Comparison of Stacking sequences for wurtzite and zinc blende

Have a read up on this, maybe find some notes in the textbook.

#### Wigner-Seitz cells and Brillouin-zone

Simple cubic reciprocal is also a simple cubic

The reciprocal lattice vectors of a FCC produces a BCC and the vice versa.

#### Miler and Miller-Bravais indices

Axis system a1 =a2 =a3 =/=c

### Cyrtsal defects

- There are no such thing as perfect crystals.
- Defects can be of zero, first, second or third order
  - zero - a missing atom in a lattices
    - Substitutional atoms are defects in the lattice positions
    - Interstitials are atom defects not on lattice points.
  - first (line defects)
    - etch dislocations
    - Screw dislocations
  - second (planar defects)
    - Stacking faults
    - Twins
  - third (volume defects)
    - Voids
    - inclusions that are 3-d and extended.
- Crystal imperfections can result from:
  - incorporation of impurities
  - thermal or mismatch stress
  - radiation damages
- Surfaces and interfaces can be regarded as two dimensional defects.
- Defects can act as scattering centres for charge carriers.
- Defects can act as recombination centers for electrons and holes

Matthiessen's rule in terms of the relaxation time for n scattering mechanism:

1/&tau;<sub>rel</sub> = (n on top, i under)&Sigma;1/&tau;<sub>i</sub>

Need to understand possible scattering mechanisms and roles of defects.

#### The lecture slide contain pictures of the types of defects!!

Conctration of defects: n<sub>Def</sub> = n<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-E<sub>a</sub>/kT</sup>

#### Line Defects
Edge dislocations

b(bar): Burgers-Vector: Direction of displacement of atoms by dislocation

There is a equation for Elastic energy of edge location:

E<sub>edge</sub> = (Gb(bar)<sup>2</sup> / 4&pi;(1-&gamma;)) ln (r/r<sub>0</sub>)

Energy reductions when b<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + b<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + b<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>
- G: Shear Modulus
- &gamma; : Poisson ratio

Dislocations have far reaching strain fields - strong impact on charge carrier transport. This is a negative effect and something that is wanted to be avoided in the semiconductor industry.

E<sub>screw</sub> = (Gb(bar)<sup>2</sup> / 4&pi;) ln (r/r<sub>0</sub>

#### Interfacial Defects

Schematic of epitaxial strain between two crystalline materials leading to formation of interfacial dislocations. It is a lattice miss match.

Lattice mismatch f = a<sub>substrate</sub> - a<sub>film</sub> / a<sub>substrate</sub> leads to strain in the film, which can be released by the formations of interfacial dislocations.

#### conductivity mobility and diffusivity

There is three IMPORTANT equations on the slide (too big to type).

Scattering of charge carriers at point defects (impurities) reduces relaxation time.
