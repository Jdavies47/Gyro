Looks like it is going to be a good idea to go over the electrons in solids lectures.

### Short History of Semiconductors

The first point contact transistor, 1947 by Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain.
It was created from a solid germanium crystal.

First semiconductor materials discovered back in 1874.

Semiconductors are characterized by there band gap. The band gap is the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction bands. A semiconductor has energy states that allow for conduction electrons but not necessarily occupied. The gap between the two bands are called the forbidden zone. Both holes and electrons in the two bands change the conductivity of the material.

In most semiconductors we use doping to change the number of charge carriers, and the conductivity of the material.

1 eV is often described as the range of binding energies between atoms. Everything thermal is in the range of 25meV.

1. Biopolar transistors 1950
1. DRAM/CPU 1970
1. Non-volatile memory 1990

Moores Law: Number of transistors on IC on approx, double every two years. This rate is largely driven by breakthroughs in nanotechnology.

This is exponential growth in device density required to keep up with this law.

##### Building blocks for semiconductor devices

1. Metal-semiconductor interface
1. p-n junction
1. Heterojunction interface
1. Metal-oxide-semiconductor structure

##### Typical range of electrical properties of metals, semiconductors and insulators.

1. Insulators - 10<sup>-18</sup> to 10<sup>-18</sup> S/cm
1. Semiconductors - 10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> S/cm
1. Conductors - 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> S/cm

Even insulators like diamond can be doped to make them conductive.

###### Most common semiconductors Structures

IV-IV (C, Si, Ge) diamond structure

Two FCC sub lattices of the same element shifted by [1/4,1/4,1/4] along the body diagonal.
