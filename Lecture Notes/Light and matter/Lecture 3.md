### Impact of impurities (continued)

Equations for conductivity, mobility and diffusivity are all in the slides

mobility - something that expresses the band structure (effective mass)

diffusivity -

We get a sharp drop in number of charge carries after a certain critical concentration of impurities.

** Indirect semiconductor ** - dispersion curves the min of the conduction band is not inline with the max of the valance band. A momentum is required to excite the electron to the conduction band.

** Direct semiconductor ** - No momentum is required for an electron to transition from valence to conduction.

How do we measure defects?
  - Photoconductivity
    - exciting electrons using photons from light, lets us observe a current. (lifetime of the carriers).
    - used to measure how perfect the semiconductor is.
    - how long can a excited electron last in the conduction band before it falls back down into the valence band.
    - I = exp (-t/&tau;)

  - Dislocation Density
    - Etch pits
    - X-ray peak broadening

&tau; &prop; (n<sub>Dislocations</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>

Dislocations act as recombination centres for charge carriers

##### Ion Irradiation

Damage cascade leads to formation or point defects and extended defects.
The excited particle causes dislocations of lattice points, controlled doping).

#### Summary

- Defects in semiconductors play eminent roles for electronic properties
- Point defects are always present in thermal equilibrium
- Impurity dopants are major source of point defects in doped semiconductors.
- There is more on the slides

### Band Structures

- Electronic propties of semiconductors are described by
  - Band structure
  - Density of states
  - Charge carrier densities

- For non-degenerate semiconductors (dopant concentrations < 10<sup>18</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>) Boltzmann statistics can be applied.
  - Small number of charge carriers
  - Can forget about Fermi statistics
  - Can use Boltzmann statistics

##### Fermi-gas

Fermi statistics (1/2 spin of the electrons) (the half spin determines the statistics we are using).

Free electrons: H(hat)&Psi; = E&Psi;
  - H(hat) = h(bar)<sup>2</sup>/2m<sub>e</sub>&Delta; (no potential for free electron)
  - Plane wave solution: &Psi = &Psi<sub>0</sub>exp(ikx)

E = h(bar)k<sup>2</sup>/2m<sub>e</sub>

We are looking around the critical points around k<sub>0</sub>.

Density of states in a electron gas:
  - D(k)=2V/(2&pi;)<sup>3</sup>
  - D(E) &prop; &sqrt;E

  Occupancy of fermi energy F(E)
  step function at 0K , but a broader curve for >0K.
