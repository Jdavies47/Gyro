### Photodetectors (continued)

- Quantum efficiency &eta;
  1. Photodiode
    - PD is based on the reverse biased junction (compare to solar cell)
    - E<sub>g</sub>&lt;hv. This leads to the the critical wavelength &lambda;<sub>c</sub>.
    - Want all the photons to be absorbed (high absorption).
    - The absorption is &prop; to &lambda;.
    - I<sub>intensity</sub> = I<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-&alpha;(&lambda;)x</sup>
    - &alpha; is band structure dependant.
    - Maximise quantum efficiency at &lambda;<sub>c</sub>
      - At low &lambda; -> low absorption and production of electron hole pairs.
      - At high &lambda; -> high absorption and most EHP generated and recombine at the surface.
  2. p-i-n PD
    - Combination and p-typed doped intrinsic and n typed doped Semiconductor
    - allows to tailor the depletion zone thickness to optimise &eta; and the frequency response.
