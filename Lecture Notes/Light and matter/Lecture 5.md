### Doped semiconductors

We can find a correlation between the majority and minority charge carrier densities.

Dopant levels affects the chemical potential.

The band gap will have a smaller band gap at higher temperatures.

What is the origin of band gaps; it is related between the interaction between electrons and positive cores.

Band gaps change with Temp due to the lattice constant shrinking with increase in T.

E<sub>f</sub>: the highest occupied energy state.

Chemical potential is &mu; which is ~ E<sub>f</sub>

### Transport properties

- The effective mass of the band structure
- We know that the electron will scatter (i.e. the sctatering time)

##### Types of scattering

 The scattering process of electron that are above the fermi edge and the electrons below it.

 the mobility is also &mu;

 Transport mechanisms:
 - Diffusion
    - Concentration gradient
    - D<sub>n</sub> is the mean free path between one scattering event to another multiplied by the thermal velocity of the electron.
    - Ficks first law
 - Drift
  - Related to the electric field

The energy between these two processes has to be distributed equally.

Correlation between Diffusion and Drift

Einsteins relation can also be expressed for the holes.

##### Recombination processes

- Excitation of charge carriers possible by bias voltage or radiation
- More notes online

Photons absorption created electron-hole pairs.
The relaxing of the electron drops it back to the valance band, this is recombination

The more charge carriers produced the higher the recombination will become.

indirect recombination: relaxation time depends on energy level of recombinations centres.

If the energy of E<sub>t</sub> is close to the intrinsic fermi energy E<sub>i</sub> then it is a efficient recombination centres
