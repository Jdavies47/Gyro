# James Davies - Physics Master (5th Year)

## Introduction

This is a git repo that I am using to keep track of my project and all code used throughout, as well as keeping track of my day to day work, revision and up and coming written work. For each stage of the project I will break down the work and task into github issues linked to a project EPIC so progress can be tracked. Day to day issues will also be created to plan around lectures and required work.
