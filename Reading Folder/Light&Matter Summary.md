## Module aims

This module covers the fundamental concepts relevant for the understanding of the physical properties of semiconducting materials, their applications in microelectronics, energy harvesting and opto-electronics as well as the principles of interaction between light and matter. The skills obtained throughout this course are of great importance in society and economy, which are both increasingly driven by the application of electronics in all walks of life.

Physics and Applications of Semiconductor Devices (100 hrs)

Based on the models developed in Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics as well as in Solid State Physics (Solid State Physics I and II), this course discusses the links between our fundamental understanding of electronic states in materials and the application of this understanding in micro- and optoelectronics as well as detector-physics. It will cover and revisit vital concepts such as crystal symmetries and defects, band structures, phonon dispersion, the interaction of charge carriers with external fields and the effect on the electronic and optical properties. Experimental techniques to synthesize semiconductors and to study their physical properties will be discussed for some of the most prominent semiconductor materials such as Si, GaAs, GaN and Ge.

A large part of this course will focus on the application of these concepts and techniques for well established and novel devices such as transistors, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), light emitting diodes/laser diodes and particle detectors.

Lasers and Atom-light Interactions (100 hrs)

An introduction of the basic features of lasers is first given leading to a more general discussion on the interaction of light with atoms. The properties of laser cavities are investigated, leading to a description of the stable operating range for cavities and the associated mode structures. The quantum mechanics of the atom-radiation interaction are considered in the semi-classical limit (treating the radiation field classically) to determine transition probabilities. Some of the spectroscopic background for the description of plasma emission processes important in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas is presented.
