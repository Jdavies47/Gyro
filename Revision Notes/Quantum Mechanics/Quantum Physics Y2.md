# Second year quantum physics

## Lecture 1

**Classical Physics** - The universe is deterministic. If we know the initial conditions well enough we can calculate how a system is going to evolve.

**Quantum Physics** - Both Revolutionary and non-intuitive.
- A fundamentally non-deterministic universe.
- The evolution of a system depends on your observation of it.
- Schr√∂dinger's cat, wave-particle duality.

**The context** - Systems that depend on atomic scale-effects.
- Particle
- Nuclear
- Atomic
- Molecular

#### Failures in Classical Mechanics

1. Atomic Spectra
1. Stability of Matter
1. Bonding of molecular Systems
1. The ultraviolet catastrophe

#### Wave-particle duality
Already well established that light exhibits both wave and particle behaviour [Young 1804 and Einstein 1905]:
- **Wave** - Interference, diffraction, refraction
- **Particle** - Photoelectric effect, Compton Scattering. (See note book for equations) - 1

de Broglie Hypothesised that wave-particle duality also applied to matter as well as radiation.
- particle has associated matter wave.
- wave properties

(See note book for equations) - 2

**Bohr's principle of complementarity** - wave and particle 'models' are complementary: the properties that we observe depend on what we are measuring.

de Broglie Wavelength examples in note book - 3

#### Young's double split experiment

- **Propagation**: Its a wave
- **Detection**: Its a particle.

The electron, neutron, etc... must have passed through both slits at the same time: position is indeterminate.

1. Explained by the uncertainty principle (See note book for equations) - 4
1. In its wave-nature, the momentum of the particle is precisely defined (&lambda; = h/p), so the position *must* be indeterminate.
1. Therefore: if we measure *x* we must destroy the wave-nature of the particle.
