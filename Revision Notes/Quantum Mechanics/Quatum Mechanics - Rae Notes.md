# Quantum Mechanics - Alastair I. M. Rae

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

Quantum mechanics was developed as a response to the failures of classical theories of mechanics and electromagnetism.

### 1.1 The Photoelectric effect

- When light hits a clean metal surface in a vacuum, it causes electrons to be emitted with a range of energies.
- With a light of a give frequency ***v*** the maximum electron energy E<sub>x</sub> is found to be equal to the difference between two terms.
- The intensity of the light is measured not to effect the energy of the electrons released, only the frequency of which they are.

<p style="text-align: center;">E<sub>x</sub> = h***&upsilon;*** - &phi;</p>

- Classical mechanics fails to explain this behaviour, as wave nature of light could never recreate this effect.
- The idea of a photon or packet of energy helps to explain what is happening. With light behaving like a particle, the collision of a particle with a nucleus would provide a quantum of energy to that nucleus in a instant, rather than a constant supply of energy from a wave.
- This incident energy explains the random electron emission from the metal.
- The &phi; can be explained as the binding energy of the electron to the nucleus, also known as the work function

### 1.2 Compton effect

- The existence of photons is also demonstrated by experiments involving the scattering of x-rays by electrons, which was first carried out by A. H. Compton.
- To explain this we also must make a postulate that the photon also carries a defined momentum as well as a quantum  of energy. This means can treat them like classic particles in many ways.
- The momentum of such a photon can be calculated as such:
<p style="text-align: center;">**p** = &#8463;**k**</p>
Where k is the wave vector of the wave and &#8463; = (h/2&pi;).

- We now consider a collision between a photon and an electron of mass *m* that is initially at rest.

****Note that angular is defined as &omega;(=2&pi;&upsilon;) where &upsilon; is the frequency.****
- After a collsion we can assume that the frequency and wave vector of the photon has changed to &omega;' and **k**' and that the electron moves off with momentum **p**<sub>e</sub>.
- From conservation laws of energy and momentum, we have:
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8463;&omega; - &#8463;&omega;' = p<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>/2*m*</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8463;**k** - &#8463;**k**' = **p**<sub>e</sub></p>
- Substituting into each other and using &omega; = ck we get:
<p style="text-align: center;">&lambda;'- &lambda; = 2&pi;&#8463;/*m*c x (1 - cos&theta;)</p>
where &theta; is the angle between **k** and **k**', and &lambda; and &lambda;' are the x-ray wavelengths.

This shifting in the wavelength of the x-ray also supports the particle nature, with the momentum change causing the shift in wavelength. For why in Compton effect the wavelength is changed and the photon not just absorbed like in the Photoelectric effect is due to the energies involved. The energy of a x-ray photon is far greater than that of the binding energy, so the electron is knocked cleanly out the solid in the collsion.

### 1.3 Line Spectra and Atomic Structure

- When an electric charge is passed though a gas, light is emitted which when examined is found to consist of a series of lines, each of which has a sharply defined frequency.
- The defined nature of the light produced concluded that the energy of the atoms in the gas, like hydrogen, have specific quantised energies.
- For hydrogen specifically:
<p style="text-align: center;">E<sub>n</sub> = 2&pi;R<sub>0</sub>&#8463;c/n<sup>2</sup></p>
Where R<sub>0</sub> is a constant known as the Rydberg Constant.
- n in this equation refers to the energy levels of electron in of hydrogen, supporting there existence.

### 1.4 De Broglie Waves

- Electrons and matter can also experience wave like properties, which can become measureable with particles as small as electrons.
- The defining feature of a wave is its properties to interfere and diffract.
- Using atomic lattice as 3D diffraction gratings this can be observed with electrons that have a low energy.
- The diffraction of neutrons has also been observed in a double slit experiment.

### 1.5 Wave particle duality

The evidence supporting the particle like nature of light is not meant or observed as fully contradictory of the wave nature of light. Quite the opposite is true for quantum mechanics, that they are complementary of each other.

##### The uncertainty principle

The uncertainty principle is a relation which relates to the limit of simultaneous measurement of wave particle duality.
<p style="text-align: center;">&Delta;x&Delta;p<sub>x</sub>&ge;&#8463;/2</p>
This is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and it is fundamental in quantum mechanics when making any simultaneous measurements of position and momentum
