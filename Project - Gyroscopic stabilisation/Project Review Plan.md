Following sections to be used:

  1. Motivation
  1. Focus
  1. Question
- Body
  1. Theory - Need to show a very good understanding of mechanics, electronics and other theory involved in the project. (large portion of the review, with diagrams included.)
    - Electrical
    - Gyroscopic
    - Motorcycle Mechanics
  1. Methods
    - Electronics
    - Mechanics
- Conclusions
  1. Context to the question.
  1. Aims of the project
