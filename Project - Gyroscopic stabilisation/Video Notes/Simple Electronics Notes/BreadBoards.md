# How to use a Breadboard

A breadboard is a device which allows circuits to be built very fast with the need to solder everything together. The components of a circuit can be pushed into the board and removed with ease. The components are simply held in with small metal clips which also act as the electrical connections too.

Looking at the structure of the boards, there is normally a small section on the edge of the board containing two columns. These are known as rails or buses and are used for power connections. The size of these power buses change from board to board.

For the connections on the main board, all holes in a row are electrically connected, until the physics break halfway through. The holes on the other wide are likewise connected to each other. The holes vertically are not connected above or below.

In quick summary the rails/buses are connected vertically and the main board is split into two but connected horizontally.

Breadboards come in all sorts of sizes, but generally only a small board is required.
