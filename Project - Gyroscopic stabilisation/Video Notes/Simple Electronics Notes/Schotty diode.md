# Schotty diodes

## What is a Schotty diode?

Schotty diodes are very similar to the regular silicon diodes but have some very key differences. (including circuit symbol).

##### Basic diode facts:

1. They only let current flow in one direction.
1. There is a voltage drop across the diode when a current is flowing, this is known as the forward voltage drop, V<sub>f</sub>.
1. Due to the current flowing through the device and the voltage drop there will be a power dissipated from it, P<sub>dissipated</sub> = V<sub>f</sub> x I.
1. Diodes do have a small leak in the reverse current allowing a small amount to flow backwards.

##### Schotty diodes

1. One of the main advantages to Schotty diodes over silicon diodes is there small voltage drop, so less power dissipated and lower operating temperature.

1. Another advantage of Sds (Schotty diode) is the very fast switching speeds, so can handle very high frequency signals, while still blocking reverse current.

1. A problem with Sds is there reverse leakage. Compared to the regular silicon diode they have a much greater reverse current, which only makes them useful in applications that don't mind a reasonable backwards current.
