# Pulse width modulation

#### What is pulse width modulation (PWM)?

A PWM controls the pulsing a signal, like a logic signal. To control a signal like a logic signal, you need to know its period, on time and off time.

The Duty cycle is the % of on time to the period.

So for a signal which has a 10 microseconds period, would have a 20% duty cycle.

For working out the voltage at high frequencies, we can multiply the peak voltage by the duty cycle.
